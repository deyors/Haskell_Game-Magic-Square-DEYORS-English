# Haskell_Game-Magic-Square-DEYORS (English)

It is a simple mathematical game whose objective is to complete magic squares or at best that your score is higher than that of your opponent, either another player or the computer. It makes use of the IO interface and has several game modes.

The game makes use of the **extensions**:

import Data.List -> Naturally integrated, nothing to install.

import System.Random -> Naturally integrated, nothing to install. However, in some versions of WinGHCi it does not run properly. It is recommended to run the game in WinHugs to avoid problems.

**EXECUTION OF THE GAME**

1. Install WinHugs and open it.
2. Drag the file to the window and drop inside.
3. When you get the message that it has loaded successfully, run the command: main.
4. Follow the instructions.

It is not intended in any way to promote the literal copying of the codes to pass any course.
